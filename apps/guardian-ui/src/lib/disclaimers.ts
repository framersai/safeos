• Veterinary care or supervision for pets
• Medical alert systems or emergency response services

export const BABY_MONITORING_DISCLAIMER = `
[BABY] BABY MONITORING ADDITIONAL NOTICE

This tool is designed to SUPPLEMENT - not replace - direct supervision.

• ALWAYS follow safe sleep guidelines (back-to-sleep, firm mattress, no loose bedding)
• NEVER leave infants unattended for extended periods
• This tool cannot detect all forms of infant distress
• Check on your baby physically and regularly
• This is not a certified medical device

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends room-sharing without bed-sharing

export const ELDERLY_MONITORING_DISCLAIMER = `
[ELDERLY] ELDERLY CARE ADDITIONAL NOTICE

This tool is designed to SUPPLEMENT - not replace - proper care.

• This is NOT a medical alert system
• Cannot detect all falls or medical emergencies  
• Not a replacement for medical emergency response systems (like Life Alert)
• Should be used alongside - not instead of - regular check-ins
• Cannot provide medical advice or intervention

For seniors at risk of falls or medical emergencies, professional medical 
alert systems with 24/7 monitoring are strongly recommended.

• Cannot detect all signs of illness or distress

export const NAP_MODE_DISCLAIMER = `
[TIME] NAP TIME MONITORING - CRITICAL NOTICE

This feature is designed ONLY for brief daytime naps (15-60 minutes)
when a caregiver needs to rest while a child sleeps nearby.

[WARNING] THIS IS NOT:
• A replacement for human supervision
• Suitable for overnight or extended sleep periods
• A substitute for proper childcare arrangements
• 100% reliable - technology can fail

[SAFETY] BEFORE USING NAP MODE:
• Ensure the child is in a safe, childproofed environment
• Position camera to clearly see the child's sleep area
• Test that your device volume is LOUD and unmuted
• Set a backup phone alarm for your maximum nap time
• Keep your device close enough to hear alerts

[IMPORTANT] IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
• Children can move silently - detection is not guaranteed
• You are FULLY RESPONSIBLE for child safety at all times
• If you feel too tired to respond to alerts, do NOT nap
• Consider having another adult available if possible

By activating Nap Mode, you acknowledge this is a SUPPLEMENTARY
convenience tool only, and you accept full responsibility for
the safety of any children under your care.
